### A Little Bit About Me
Welcome to my Github page. My name is Maeve Kelly. I am a junior Journalism major at [Lehigh University](https://www1.lehigh.edu). I am originally from San Francisco, but now have the pleasure of calling Bethlehem my home. 

I never thought I would study Journlaims in college, but after taking Communications 1 my freshman year, I was hooked. I'm really excited to take data journalism because I am notorious for being bad with technology. I hope this class can teach me alot about the technology side of journalism. There is so much more to journalism than just writing!

# Fall 2021 First-Year College Enrollment Percentages Infographic

The data on this inforgraphic was found on the Lehigh University [Profile](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf) 
The majority of first-year students in Fall of 2021 were enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. There are a total of 1519 students in the class. This data is published each year by the University. The College of Health has the least number of students only two years after its inception.

# What percentage of registered voters (ages 18-24) actually voted in the 2020 presidential election?

The data for this inforgraphic was found on the census.gov [Voting Table](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/p20/585/table05_2.xlsx).
I chose this data for the infograhpic because I think it is important for college students to understand voter turnout rates. The infographic depicts how education level affects likelihood to vote. It was concluded that the higher one's education level, the more likely it is for them to go out and vote. 18-24 year olds have the lowest voter turnout rate of any age group. This infographic shows that a majority of registered voters (ages 18-24) who are participating in higher education actually turn up to vote. To locate this data, I looked up voter turnout rates on Google and found a [link](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/p20-585.html) to a series of tables breaking down voter turnout numbers. I chose to look into 18-24 year olds because I was curious how college education affected voter turnout.
