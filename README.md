### A Little Bit About Me
Welcome to my Github page. My name is Maeve Kelly. I am a junior Journalism major at [Lehigh University](https://www1.lehigh.edu). I am originally from San Francisco, but now have the pleasure of calling Bethlehem my home. 

I never thought I would study Journlaims in college, but after taking Communications 1 my freshman year, I was hooked. I'm really excited to take data journalism because I am notorious for being bad with technology. I hope this class can teach me alot about the technology side of journalism. There is so much more to journalism than just writing!
